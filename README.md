👋 Hi, I'm Nikita (@NIK-VOLO)

I am a software engineer, data analyst, and robotics programmer.

I have attained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Rutgers University, where I primarily worked on command-line, AI, and software projects. I'm continuing to expand my skills in software engineering and data science through self-study of the following topics:
- Software best practices, methodologies, and frameworks
- Predictive modeling 
- Computer vision 
- Full-stack development

I'm eager to work alongside other ambitious developers who wish to continuously learn and innovate!
