ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nikita (@NIK-VOLO)

I am a software engineer, data analyst, robotics programmer, and eager student aspiring to explore software engineering, data science, and advanced machine learning in more detail.

I have attained a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University, where I primarily worked on command-line projects and software with GUI. I'm continuing to expand my skills in the software engineering and data science fields through self-study of the following topics:
- Software best practices, methodologies, and frameworks (applied to projects)
- Predictive modeling 
- Computer vision 
- Front-end development

I've pinned some of the projects I am most proud of to my main GitHub page.
